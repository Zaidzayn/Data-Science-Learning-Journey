# 🧠 Python Concepts – From Lists to OOP

This repository contains my Python learning journey where I covered core concepts from basic *Lists* to *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* including *Classes* and *Objects*.

---

## 📘 Covered Topics

This single notebook includes:

1. ✅ Lists – Creating, indexing, slicing, methods  
2. ✅ Tuples – Immutable data structures  
3. ✅ Sets – Unique value collections  
4. ✅ Dictionaries – Key-value pairs  
5. ✅ Loops – for, while, nested loops  
6. ✅ Conditional Statements – if, elif, else  
7. ✅ Functions – Definition, arguments, return values  
8. ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
   - Classes & Objects  
   - __init__ constructor  
   - Instance variables  
   - Methods

## 🚀 Next Steps

I'll be moving forward with:

- Inheritance & Polymorphism in OOP  
- Exception Handling  
- Numpy, Pandas  
- Data Visualization  
- Machine Learning Algorithms  
- Projects
